Project Description
Being able to create predictive models is very cool, but translating fancy models into real business value is a major challenge if the training data isn't stored efficiently.

You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, created ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.
