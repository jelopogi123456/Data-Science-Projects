Project Description
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. 
Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. 
Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.
